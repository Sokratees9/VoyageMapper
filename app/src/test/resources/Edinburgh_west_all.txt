The west of [[Edinburgh]] is the area you traverse coming from the airport or Glasgow towards city centre. It's a modern low-rise tract of suburbs, retail and light industry that could be on the edge of any British city, but it has accommodation, the zoo, and Murrayfield rugby stadium.

The city is expanding rapidly at its western edge near the airport, with a new district taking shape around the villages of Newbridge and Kirkliston. The city boundaries extended in 1995 and now include [[South Queensferry]], but this continues to feel like a separate town.

{{marker | name=Edinburgh Airport | type=go | lat=55.9486 | long=-3.3641 }} ({{IATA|EDI}}) is at the west edge of the city, see [[Edinburgh#Get in]] for flights and facilities. The tram and Airlink Bus 100 run downtown with stops in the west city, and Skylink Bus 400 runs through the west and south city fringes.

{{marker | name=Haymarket station | type=go | lat=55.9453 | long=-3.2187}} is the west transport hub. All trains from the north, west and southwest stop here on their way to the main station at Waverley; so do the trams, Airlink Bus 100 and many city bus routes. The station is modern behind its Victorian facade, with ticket offices, machines, shops, toilets and waiting areas; lots more facilities in the streets outside. There is lift access to all platforms, including the mysterious Platform 0.

{{marker | name=South Gyle station | type=go | lat=55.9366 | long=-3.2998}} is a halt for trains from Fife.

{{marker | name=Edinburgh Park station | type=go | lat=55.9276 | long=-3.3077}} has trains from [[Dunblane]] via [[Stirling]] and [[Falkirk]], and from [[Helensburgh]] via [[Dumbarton]], Glasgow Queen St and Livingston - don't take this ponderous route for Glasgow, go into Haymarket for the fast trains.

{{marker | name=Slateford | type=go | lat=55.9265 | long=-3.2441 }} has even slower trains from Glasgow Central, taking 80 min across the central industrial brownfields. These also groan to a halt at {{marker | name=Kingsknowe | type=go | lat=55.9190 | long=-3.2642 }}, {{marker | name=Wester Hailes | type=go | lat=55.9144 | long=-3.2838 }} and {{marker | name=Curriehill | type=go | lat=55.9006 | long=-3.3185}}. You'd only ride them to city centre to connect with another train, otherwise the bus is more convenient and cheaper.

'''[http://www.lothianbuses.com/ Buses]''' fan out from city centre across the west. Principal routes are:
: - west from Haymarket to Murrayfield and Corstorphine: 12, 26 (with N26 at night), 31 and Airlink 100.
: - southwest from Haymarket to Sighthill, Wester Hailes, Gyle and Heriot Watt University: 3, 22, 25 (with N25 the university night bus), 33, 34 and 35.
: - from Haymarket to Slateford and Balerno: 44

'''The tram''' runs every 10 min from the airport to Ingliston Park & Ride, Gogarburn, Edinburgh Gateway station, Gyle Park shopping centre, Edinburgh Park central and station, Bankhead, Saughton, Balgreen, Murrayfield Stadium, Haymarket, West End, Princes St, St Andrews Square (for main bus and railway stations), then away down to Leith and Newhaven. See [[Edinburgh#Get around]] for times and fares.

* '''Donaldson's School''' or Hospital is the grand mock-Jacobean building (pictured at top of page) on the main road a quarter mile west of Haymarket station. Completed in 1850, it was a school for pupils with communication difficulties. But it became impractical and the school moved out to Linlithgow in 2008; the building has been converted to luxury flats.
* {{marker | name=Lochrin Basin | type=see | lat=55.9427 | long=-3.2081 }} is the east terminus of the Union Canal. When completed in 1822 it continued a little further to Tolcross at the edge of [[Edinburgh/Old Town | Old Town]]. It fell into disuse and was closed in 1965, but re-opened in 2001 and is fully navigable, with a firm towpath for strolling or cycling. The canal courses west to Slateford, vaulting over the Water of Leith by an aqueduct, and out to Kingsknowe, Wester Hailes and eventually to [[Falkirk]], where a wheel hoists boats into the Forth and Clyde Canal.

* {{marker | name=Cramond | type=see | lat=55.9803 | long=-3.3003 }} is an attractive little village at the outlet of the River Almond, popular with amateur painters. It may be older than Edinburgh itself, as there are Mesolithic remains from 8500 BC, and the Romans built a fort later called ''Caer Amon'', fort on the Almond, hence Cramond. There's a little sandy beach behind the breakwater but the Forth this far up is muddy. Walks lead upstream to a waterfall and main road, out to Cramond Island at low tide, and east along the esplanade to Silverknowes. The ferry no longer rows across the Almond, so you have to divert upstream to join the coast trail west towards [[South Queensferry]]. Cramond has a pub and tearooms. The free parking lot is small and fills up on fine afternoons, or take Bus 41.
* '''Cramond Island''' is reached by a rough, mile-long causeway passable for two hours either side of low tide. (Check [https://easytide.admiralty.co.uk/?PortID=0225 Easytide] for Leith online, and double-check with the times posted at the start of the causeway.) The island has grubby graffiti-covered World War II artillery positions, you come for the view across the Forth.
* {{marker | name=Silverknowes | type=see | lat=55.9797 | long=-3.2795 }} a mile east along the esplanade has lots of free parking, so it can be a better starting point for visiting Cramond. The esplanade continues east for two miles but becomes industrial towards Granton Harbour.
* {{marker | name=Balerno | type=see | lat=55.8849 | long=-3.3404 }}: see [[Edinburgh/South]] for this village at the head of the Water of Leith Walkway, Malleny Gardens, Currie rugby club, and access to the Pentland Hills.
* '''Jupiter Artland''' is a modern sculpture park off A71 to the west, see [[Livingston (Scotland)]].

It's a wooded park with multiple access points, popular with walkers, joggers and winter tobogganists, and its south is serenaded by exotic bellows from the beasts in the zoo. The tower near the top is dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, as if his Gothic Rocket on Princes Street wasn't enough. 200 yards west of the tower by Clermiston Rd is a walled garden. Views are somewhat restricted by the woods but here and there are vistas of the castle and sea.
