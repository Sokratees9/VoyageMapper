With wonderful palaces, thousand-year-old churches and basilicas, grand romantic ruins, opulent monuments, ornate statues and graceful fountains, Rome has an immensely rich historical heritage and cosmopolitan atmosphere, making it one of Europe's and the world's most visited, famous, influential and beautiful capitals. Today, Rome has a growing nightlife scene and is also seen as a shopping heaven, being regarded as one of the fashion capitals of the world; some of Italy's oldest jewellery and clothing establishments were founded in the city.

This tiny country completely within Rome is packed with more history and artwork than most cities in the world, and indeed many countries. St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel are all in Vatican City.\nThis article also covers the nearby Roman neighbourhoods of Borgo and Prati, which measure 49 and 127 hectares respectively (compared to the Vatican's 49 hectares).",

What most characterizes this place is its unspoiled nature and traditions which are visible still today. Its history is characterized by a mixture of legends and actual facts. That is why it is not surprising that its coat of arms is represented by a small boat, even though the seaside is at least 80 km away.",
