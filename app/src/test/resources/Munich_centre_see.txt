=== Marienplatz ===
* '''Marienplatz''' (''on S- and U-Bahn'') is the square at the heart of the old city. It takes its name from Mariensäule, the central golden statue to the Virgin Mary, who was credited with saving the city in 1638 from destruction during Swedish occupation: ''De Optimo Maximo Virgini Deiparae, Boicae Dominae . . . '', yadda yadda yah. The south part of the square is flanked by the imposing old and new Town Halls. North part is a heroic crater, as it's being excavated for the new S-Bahn tunnel and station. You can still access all shops, pubs etcetera here but it's expected to remain a mess at least until 2026.

For most visitors the ornate neo-Gothic exterior is experience enough.

| content=This huge church defines the Munich skyline with its twin onion-domed towers, a shade over 98 m tall - the money ran out for the planned spires. It's the Roman Catholic cathedral, but always known locally as Frauenkirche. It was built from 1469 to 1488 in brick because of a lack of suitable local stone; the towers were only completed in 1525, cleverly anticipating a law of 2004 that no structure within Altstadt may exceed 99 m in height. Although its style is Gothic, it's fairly simple outside and in, without the usual ornamentation of that style. Eleven kings or archdukes of Bavaria are interred here. The church was bombed in wartime and full restoration took until 1994. Its three naves are of equal height, creating a single hall soaring so high that you can't see the windows, and light floods in from no visible source. This is in legend is the feature that caused the devil to stamp in pique, leaving a black footprint (''Teufelstritt'') within a yellow flagstone just inside the entrance. You can climb the south tower.

=== Odeonsplatz ===
[[File:München_Feldherrnhalle_BW_2017-03-16_19-44-35.jpg | thumb | 300px | Feldherrnhalle ]]
This area north of medieval Altstadt was developed in the 19th century. The square was named for Odeon concert hall, now a government building. U-Bahn Odeonsplatz is at its north end.
* '''Feldherrnhalle''' (mind the spelling, not "Feldherren-") closes the south end of the square. It was built 1841-44 under Ludwig I to the glory of the Bavarian army. It's modelled on the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence. On the morning of 9 Nov 1923, this was the scene of Hitler's first power-grab, the short-lived ''putsch'' which ended in a bloody shoot-out and his arrest. In 1933 it became a Nazi shrine, and all passers-by were required to give the Nazi salute. "Drückebergergasse" was the nickname given to the alley behind, used by those who didn't care to salute: "Drücke" means "ducking out".
* '''Preysing Palais''' on Drückebergergasse just behind Feldherrnhalle was built in the 1720s as a bling palace. It's now shops and offices.

* '''[http://www.finanzgarten.net/ Finanzgarten]''' is the bosky, informal green space just north of Hofgarten, a complete contrast. The area was part of Altstadt's defensive walls until those were no longer needed after the Thirty Years' War. Later uses included a market garden for a monastery that contrived to go bust (they're probably still reciting penitential ''Ave Maria''s to this day) and a Ministry of Finance, hence the name. In 1984 the Ministry of Agriculture was finally persuaded to park its cars elsewhere and the garden was landscaped into its present form. It's adorned with statues of notable German poets such as, um, Confucius.

=== Lehel ===
"Lehel" means scrubs or boondocks, floodprone land by the river with shacks and small fields. Lying just east of the centre, it became part of Munich in the 18th century, and blossomed in the 19th with the construction of Prinzregentenstraße. It's now a high-price district not part of the historic Altstadt, but convenient to describe on this page as it's just a short walk east.

* '''St Anna''' is the name of two churches next to Lehel U-Bahn station. The first, west side of the street, is the monastery church built in the 1730s. It also served as the parish church for this poor district, whose residents were locked out of Altstadt gates by night. The Franciscans took over the monastery in 1827 and remain there. The new parish church east side of the street was completed in 1892.

* {{marker | name=Prater island | type=see | lat=48.136 | long=11.590 }} is one of two large river islands in the Isar. Originally these were small, shifting sandbanks, then in the 19th century they were consolidated and developed. A tavern opened, with a funfair inspired by Prater in Vienna, and so the island (a fusion of three) got its name. But Orson Welles never got to ride its carousel, and the funfair went bust through disruption of building Maximilianstraße, which now bisects it and connects to the eastern district of [[Munich/Haidhausen | Haidhausen]]. One fellow wanted to experiment with fireworks was ordered to live away at the south tip, thus dubbed ''Feuerwerkinsel''.

Within the plaza are the Wittelsbacherbrunnen fountain, the New Stock Exchange (''Neue Börse'') of 1901 and the House of Artists (''Künstlerhaus''). It's a lively place at night. U-Bahn Karlsplatz (Stachus) is closest for the west end, Odeonsplatz for the east end, and Tram 19 (stop ''Lenbachplatz'') runs through it.
* '''Platz der Opfer des Nationalsozialismus''' (Square of the Victims of Nazism, ''U-Bahn U3, U4, U5, U6: Odeonsplatz'') is the northeast extension of Maximiliansplatz - the Gestapo headquarters stood here. Today an eternal flame burns in its centre.

This version survived until bombed in wartime and was restored in the 1950s.

The church crypt holds many tombs of the Wittelsbach dynasty, including "mad king" Ludwig II.

| content=This Late Baroque confection was built from 1733 to 1746 as a private chapel by Egid Quirin Asam - he could see the altar from his house next door. His brother, Cosmas Damian Asam, did the frescoes. The church is dedicated to St John Nepomuk (1345-93), a Bohemian monk cast into the river Vltava in Prague at the behest of King Wenceslaus IV. Legend has it that Nepomuk refused to divulge the queen's confessional secrets, but his real crime was to back the wrong candidate for abbot. The church is wonderful by candlelight, especially at the Christmas Eve service, replete with Bavarian singers in the choir stall.

* '''Kreuzkirche''' midway down Kreuzstraße was built in 1478 as a cemetery church - the ''kreuz'' (cross) in this case was a crossroads. It has a plain brick exterior, the interior was re-done in Baroque style in 1620.
* '''Sendlinger Tor''', one of the ancient city gates, is where you step out of Altstadt into [[Munich/Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt | Ludwigsvorstadt]]. The U-Bahn station is just beyond.
